# simon

I learned that you can push from your terminal and that is super cool. I also learned how to better use VS Code and it is so much easier

I also learned that github is great because I definitely messed something up and was able to see my previous code and fix it. 

I accidentally deployed to the service "simom" instead of "simon" and I'm not sure if I need to go back and fix that or if it will be an issue or not.... but I learned that I need to be more careful and pay more attention to detail, and try not to rush so much. If I had discovered that little typo earlier it would have saved a lot of time haha
